### ezGestures ###
**ezGestures** is a gesture recognition library for [Processing](http://www.processing.org/). It works by analyzing mouse or [Wiimote](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_Remote) movements while dragging, and comparing the motion against a [regular expression](http://www.regular-expressions.info/) to find a match. It was originally developed for [tweetPad](http://www.silentlycrashing.net/tweetpad/), but has been modified into a more general version for plugging into any project.
